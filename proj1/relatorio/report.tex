    We start this project by extracting the dataframe "BudgetItaly" from the "Ecdat" and extract the pfood column as it's asked using the commands:

    library('Ecdat')

    data(package = "Ecdat")

    dat = as.data.frame(BudgetItaly)

    dat <- subset(dat, select = -4)

    Since we want to study the year 73 we create a different variable that only has that row so it's easier to compare visually the results using the command:

    dat\textunderscore 73 <- dat[73,]"
